## About TutorTank
A groundbreaking digital mentorship platform that
dynamically evaluates each learner's grasp of concepts at every
stage, offering curated educational material to enrich their
learning adventure.

## Key Features
1. Data-driven Insights for Educators: The platform could generate data-driven insights and analytics for educators, providing them with valuable information about each learner's progress, areas of difficulty, and learning patterns. Educators could use this information to tailor their instruction and support individual learners more effectively.

2. Personalized/ Customized Learning Processes Machine learning allows for a more accurate, personalized approach toward every individual's progress. Educators these days can use ML algorithms to track every learnerâ€™s progress individually. Instead of creating a generalized curriculum to be applied in all classrooms and for every learner, they can focus on delivering the right information based on their progress.

## Working
The model operates in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, where an RL agent interacts with a simulated environment representing users solving math problems. The agent selects categories (e.g., geometry, probability) based on the users' historical performance, then asks questions from the MathQA dataset. After each question, the agent receives feedback on correctness, updating the user's score and providing rewards accordingly. The agent's goal is to maximize user scores over multiple episodes through adaptive category selection and user interaction, ultimately improving the user's performance in solving math word problems.
